# Segment-Encryption (SED)

Segment-Encryption-Decryption (SED) is a project I made during a all nighter for fun as a proof of concept to evading modern AntiVirus memory scanners by encrypting a function during runtime, then decrypting it when the function needs to be executed, then reencrypting once the function has finished executing.
